A software engineer by day, a vampire by night. Due to the decreasing number of healthy people, I have hard times to find good quality blood. You might often find me traveling distance parts of the world seeking to find healthy ones. I even thought about running a local organic blood blank to keep my vampire buddies in shape (need is the mother of invention). You can tell I have an entrepreneur mind, just need a bald head, and off we go.

By now, you should understand I am not serious, in fact I am never 100% serious in any given moment (maybe with funeral exceptions, not so sure..). I live in the great city of Montreal in Canada, amazing people, colorful culture, and of course winter. You love it, you hate it, the winter is a forced part of northern lives.    

## Me

I have major in Computer engineering and Mathematics, got them concurrently (survived with minor injuries). I didn't really let the math get into my blood but give me a unique way of thinking, problem solving skills. Being a computer engineer makes you know many things about the machine, but the hardware part was never my real interest. That being said, I consider myself a software engineer as it is a subset of my major. 

I like engineering complex systems where different layers interact in harmony, like the persistent layer and the business logic. The back-end development is what I like, and always my ultimate choice in the world of web application development. I have used different languages for different scenarios, but Python stole my heart literally. Initially used it to analyze massive amount of passive DNS data for security research. It is just amazing.

I also have a master in information security, specifically in DNS security. The DNS protocol is a great protocol but also naive, I investigated a vulnerability in the use of resource record types like TXT and CNAME. I have full confident in the future of DNS, as long as administrators configure those DNS servers properly.

To be seasoned and wrapped...
