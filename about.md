I am Mert, a software engineer from Montr√©al, Canada. I am focused in back-end development with no specific language constraint. If I have to, I can also make wonders with JavaScript (+ jQuery + DOM + CSS) in the front-end but only if I have to. The back-end is the real engineering to me.

I have major in Computer engineering and Mathematics, got them concurrently (survived with minor injuries). I also have a masters in information security, wrote my thesis in a special case in DNS security. I and a colleague of mine investigated the abuse of DNS for data transfer by some malware families.
