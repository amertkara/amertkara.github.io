title: About

A software engineer by day, a vampire by night. Due to the decreasing number of healthy people, I have hard times to find good quality blood. You might often find me traveling distance parts of the world seeking to find healthy ones. The need is the mother of invention, even thought about running a local organic blood blank to keep my vampire buddies in shape. You can tell I have an entrepreneur, just need a bald head and off we go.

By now, you should understand I am not serious, hell I was never 100% in any given moment in my life (maybe with funeral exceptions, not so sure..). I live in the great city of Montreal in Canada, amazing people, colorful culture, and of course winter. You love it, you hate it, the winter is a forced part of the northern lives.    

## Me

I have major in Computer engineering and Mathematics, got them concurrently (survived with minor injuries). I didn't really let the math get into my blood rather give me a unique way of thinking, it just makes a true problem solver. Being a computer engineer makes you know many things about the machine, but the hardware part was never my real interest. Besides, the field has too many overlaps between professions so the hardware should be handled by real electronics geniuses. That being said, I consider myself a software engineer as it is a subset of my major. 

I like engineering complex systems where different layers interact in harmony, like the persistent layer and business logic. The back-end development is what I like, and always my ultimate choice in the world of web application development. I have used different languages for different scenarios, but Python stole my heart literally. Initially used it to analyze massive amount of passive DNS data for security research. There shouldn't be any comparison between any language but it is my #1!. 

I also have a master in the information security, specifically in DNS security. The protocol's itself is very simple but amazingly strong to handle the need of today's internet. I have full confident in the future of DNS, as long as administrators configure those DNS servers properly.

To be seasoned and wrapped...
